# Discrete-Structure

Discrete Structure is an excellent tool for improving reasoning and problem-solving abilities. We highly suggest that starting from the 6th grade, students should some effort into studying fundamental discrete math, especially combinatorics, graph theory, discrete geometry, number theory, and discrete probability.
